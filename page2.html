<h1> About Me </h1>
<p class= "content1">
I have a long-lived passion for data analysis and dissemination and have a background in public policy and social research. Digital technologies are an essential part of how we communicate and share information today and it is becoming increasingly important to be an active participant in this environment, not a passive recipient. Training with <a href = "https://wearecodenation.com/"> Code Nation </a> (click 'Code Nation' for link) has been an opportunity to get to grips with this, using two of my favourite skills: logical thought and creative expression.
