        <li> <b>1.1 The Purpose of IT in Modern Business </b> - The digital world is changing at an increasing rate. IT is no longer considered a single department within an organisation and 34% of companies reportedly see digital technology as the main driver of innovation<sup><small>1</small></sup>. It is considered an aid not only to marketing, but to competitive advantage<sup><small>2</small></sup>. The fast acquisition, processing and utilisation of information within business<sup><small>3</small></sup> is essential to the modern business strategy, but failure to embrace new technologies in the right way presents security risks.</li> <br>
        <li> <b>1.2 Methods, Skills and Resources </b> - Successful digital projects can require a wide range of skills, including an understanding of account management, strategy and business analysis<sup><small>4</small></sup>. As well as the more obvious digital platforms, it is also important to have a strong grasp of project management software and content management systems<sup><small>5</small></sup>. Moreover, it is essential to have the ability to collaborate with and manage people. The digital landscape is a dynamic one and it is important to continue to engage in the community to take advantage of new resources and good practice.</li><br>
        <li> <b>1.3 Planning and Acting with IT</b> - IT is an invaluable tool in organising and tracking projects. In building this website I have begun to incorporate <a href = "https://trello.com/b/epxFk2CW/website-project"> Trello </a> into my processes. This allows me to define tasks and place them into an accessible ‘board’ format by which to manage my time. It is important to bring the insights of project management to even small projects. This involves defining the scope of the project and conducting timescale analyses to ensure that the work is done to target.</li><br>
        <li> <b>1.4 Risks in Digital Projects</b> - Another challenge for the digital consultant is in coming to an agreement with clients on the best strategy, in part because there may be limits to the knowledge of clients about digital space<sup><small>6</small></sup>. It is crucial to consider and plan for the sorts of things which constitute failure in digital projects. For example, it is important that the end product is user-friendly and, depending on the project, potentially adaptable and scalable to future growth and market needs<sup><small>7</small></sup> </li><br>
        <li> <b>1.5 What's the Tech for the Job?</b> - As mentioned, it’s important to follow what the digital community is saying to discover new resources and revise strategy. Once one is aware of what is available, it’s important to choose the right path. There are a number of considerations here: useability, affordability and usefulness.</li> <br>
        <li> <b>1.6 What Tech Have I Used? </b> - Enabling access to technology is an important part of our growing economy and Git is a free, open source system for managing projects of any size. Allowing others to check code and advise on problems is a great feature of the technology community. GitHub also helps to keep track of version changes as and when they are needed by giving time and name stamps to each code push.<br> <p>One feature of digital projects is that one must respond to challenges as they emerge, particularly when dealing with unfamiliar fields. Since I have never set up a website before, a large part of my work was in defining the scope of the task. Trello has helped to clarify thought, give direction and manage my time.</p></li>
        <li> <b>1.7 The Impact of GDPR on Digital Projects</b> - GDPR or ‘General Data Protection Legislation’ came into force beginning 25th May 2018<sup><small>8</small></sup>  with the aim of giving individuals in the EU control over their own data, both professional and private. It gives people the right of consent, access and removal of information companies hold about them. There are punitive fines for non-compliance, but degrees of compliance among businesses has varied <sup><small>9</small></sup>. The most crucial challenges for digital projects are to implement processes which mandate consumer consent to data collection and manage the right to access and the right to be forgotten. On the other hand, increasing user trust can have a positive impact upon an organisation’s reputation and having more personalised, consensual data is much more likely to be accurate and up-to-date.</li>
