        <li> <b>1.1 The Purpose of IT in Modern Business </b>- The digital world is changing at an increasing rate. IT is no longer considered a single department within an organisation and 34% of companies reportedly see digital technology as the main driver of innovation<sup><small>1</small></sup> (ref-Forbes or Accenture). It is considered an aid not only to marketing, but to competitive advantage<sup><small>2</small></sup> (Forbes). The fast acquisition, processing and utilisation of information within business<sup><small>3</small></sup> (bizFluent) is essential to the modern business strategy, but failure to embrace new technologies in the right way presents security risks.</li> <br>
        <li> <b>1.2 Methods, Skills and Resources </b>- Successful digital projects can require a wide range of skills, including an understanding of, for example, account management, strategy and business analysis<sup><small>4</small></sup> (Digital Project Manager). As well as the more obvious digital platforms, it is also important to have a strong grasp of project management software and content management systems<sup><small>5</small></sup> (Workamajig). Moreover, it is essential to have the ability to collaborate with and manage people. The digital landscape is a dynamic one and it is important to continue to engage in the community to take advantage of new resources and good practice.</li><br>
        <li> <b>1.3 Planning and Acting with IT</b>- IT is an invaluable tool in organising and tracking projects. In building a website I have begun to incorporate Trello into my processes. This allows me to define and divide tasks into an accessible ‘board’ format by which to manage my time. (link!)</li><br>
