        <li> <b>2.1 Review of the Ongoing Use of IT Tools </b>- Building my website has allowed me to learn new digital tools. Visual Studio Code is a highly adaptable coding program with a responsive debugging console. Although I still have a lot to learn and practise, using Visual Studio has helped much of the JavaScript, HTML and CSS processes sink in. Adjusting to the regular use of Trello and Slack has been slower, since I automatically revert to my normal mode of planning the day and communicating materials.</li> <br>
        <li> <b>2.2 Appropriateness of IT Tools </b>- Visual Studio Code seems a powerful means of building web pages and once GitHub terminal commands are remembered it is easy to update the online code. Trello is straightforward and intuitive to use and is a means of sharing one’s schedule with team members, though I still like the old-fashioned pen and paper. </li><br>
        <li> <b>2.3 Assessment of Project </b> - I would have liked to have weeks to design the website to make it good-looking, functional and distinctive. In the time I had, I felt pressured to simply get things down. On the other hand, being forced to learn basic techniques quickly can force the mind to retain the information. I would definitely have liked to get better used to flex boxes and apply them to most of my styling. This is something I will look into in the future. This project has made me curious to learn more advanced techniques, since website building has myriad uses in all sectors. Also, I would definitely look more into increasing accessibility for those with different disabilities, since I think that mere compliance is inferior to a planned, customised solution.</li><br>
        <li> <b>2.4 Potential Improvements</b> - Flex would be a great way to make my website suited to all browsers and manage overall styling. Also, any published website would need to respect copyright on images and animations. This might demand some element of image design. As I said before, I would work further on accessibility. I would also plan out an intelligent site map for more complicated websites to improve useability. </li><br>
        <li> <b>2.5 Review Outcomes</b> - I began by verifying the basic processes for HTML and CSS, after which I planned out the design of the website and the individual tasks to perform. Admittedly, I didn’t use Trello at this stage. I started to incorporate it into my work later on, when I needed to take note of individual challenges. I drafted – but didn’t perfect – the content for the website so that I could comfortably begin to work on the design. Once I felt comfortable that I had achieved many of my objectives I went back to work on the content. I regularly pushed my code to my public GitHub so that my changes could be tracked.</li>
