        <li> <b>3.1 Benefits and Drawbacks of Resources </b> - Feeling obliged to update oneâ€™s Trello board regularly can take time and attention away from the job at hand and for my own work I would only update it once or twice a day. For GitHub, I think I would stick to a daily update in order to track changes and seek community help when I had a problem. I would hope that in repeating this project I would have remembered many of the VS commands and be used to spotting syntax errors which have significantly decreased my speed of work. Fortunately, Visual Studio Code is helpful in spotting errors or at least identifying the point at which the error occurred. <p>If I had worked in a team we could have divided some of the work. For example, different people may have worked on different pages, speeding things up. On the other hand, doing it individually has forced me to learn much faster, which will benefit me in future projects.</p> </li>
        <li> <b>3.2 Increasing Productivity and Efficiency </b> - Learning to use CSS across pages and even across sites can rapidly increase efficiency by having a standard format. For unfamiliar commands, W3Schools has been very helpful, but I would hope to remember some of the more simple ones, saving time. </li><br>
        <li> <b>3.3 Solutions for the Future </b> - Slack is a great way to share with collaborators and facilitate team work. I would definitely work in a team for larger scale projects, given the opportunity. This would require the website structure to be clearly worked out in advance. I would also implement a sophisticated project management system, such as Prince2. Before any structuring, however, I would research further into styling, accessibility and copyright. This would take only a couple of days but would be absolutely worthwhile in ensuring the site is a success.</li><br>
        <li> <b>3.4 Testing Digital Solutions</b> - A fit for purpose website would be wholly free of coding errors and redundancies and the code would provide comments on what each section is doing, so we would make sure to check these things regularly with, for example, unit testing<sup><small>10</small></sup>. This might also involve collaborating with the digital community, though carefully and with respect for commercial privacy. Also, we would need to consumer test in terms of useability, accessibility and aesthetics. This would not be a heavy commitment in terms of time or cost but would prevent problems after the site went live for which the team would need to be recalled. We might need to apply a content management system to allow others to update the site without writing into the code. This would needed to be tested with the client. </li><br>
