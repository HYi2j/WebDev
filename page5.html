        <li> <b>3.1 Benefits and Drawbacks of Resources </b> - Feeling obliged to update one’s Trello board regularly can take time and attention away from the job at hand and for my own work I would only update it once or twice a day. For GitHub, I think I would stick to a daily update in order to track changes and seek community help when I had a problem. I would hope that in repeating this project I would have remembered many of the VS commands and be used to spotting syntax errors which have significantly decreased my speed of work. Fortunately, Visual Studio Code is helpful in spotting errors or at least identifying the point at which the error occurred. <p>If I had worked in a team we could have divided some of the work. For example, different people may have worked on different pages, speeding things up. On the other hand, doing it individually has forced me to learn much faster, which will benefit me in future projects.</p> </li>
        <li> <b>3.2 Increasing Productivity and Efficiency </b> - Learning to use CSS across pages and even across sites can rapidly increase efficiency through use of standard format. For unfamiliar commands, W3Schools has been very helpful, but I would hope to remember some of the more simple ones, saving time. I will also be benefitted in the future from a greater understanding of the scope of the task at hand, and this will allow me to plan out my approach at the very beginning.</li><br>
        <li> <b>3.3 Solutions for the Future </b> - Slack is a great way to share with collaborators and facilitate team work. I would definitely work in a team for larger scale projects, given the opportunity. As with all such projects, this would require the website structure to be clearly worked out in advance. I would also implement a sophisticated project management system, such as Prince2. Before any structuring, however, I would research further into styling, accessibility and copyright. This would take only a couple of days but would be absolutely worthwhile in ensuring the site is a success.</li><br>
        <li> <b>3.4 Testing Digital Solutions</b> - A fit for purpose website would be wholly free of coding errors and redundancies and the code would provide comments on what each section is doing, so we would make sure to check these things regularly with, for example, unit testing<sup><small>10</small></sup>. This might also involve collaborating with the digital community, though carefully and with respect for commercial privacy. Also, we would need to consumer test in terms of useability, accessibility and aesthetics. This would not be a heavy commitment in terms of time or cost and would prevent problems after the site went live. We might need to apply a content management system to allow others to update the site without writing into the code. This would needed to be tested with the client. For my self, I ensured to check all links were active and that the site was compatible with browsers.</li><br>
        <li> <b> 4.1 Selected Content and Layout</b>  - I have chosen to lay out the content over seven pages to aid comprehension and avoid cluttering. The navigation bar is at the top of each page as is the convention. Given the brevity of overall content, I didn’t need to provide a sitemap section, but this is something I would definitely do for larger projects. The navigation bar is static because there are not multiple subsections, but this is a simple feature to add into denser websites. </li> <br>
        <li> <b> 4.2 Copyright Constraints</b> - My use of some images without permission is likely to infringe copyright if used for commercial or personal gain, but it is acceptable for the purpose of education<sup><small>11</small></sup>. Copyright can be a complicated issue and it is always best to err on the side of safety. This means that permission must be sought for the use of any image or similar content which is produced by another person or organisation. Even styling can fall under copyright, so it is important not to imitate other sites.  </li> <br> 
        <li> <b> 4.3 Accessibility</b> - The fact that <alt> tags for imported content are obliged in HTML already takes care of one issue surrounding accessibility, helping those with visual limitations. Another worthwhile feature is to provide subtitles for video content for the hearing-impaired. For those with colour-blindness, it is helpful to underline hyperlinks and to provide good contrast between text and background colour. It is also good practise to write out that a link is being inserted, for those with screen readers. It is beneficial to provide a dedicated accessibility guide on the website and this is something I will explore in the future<sup><small>12</small></sup>.</li> <br>
        <li> <b> 4.4 Filetype Compatibility </b> - It is always best to stick to filetypes supported by standard browsers. These include GIF and JPEG or PNG for pictures and animations and AVI for audio-video. HTML is good for content and CSS for styling.</li>
